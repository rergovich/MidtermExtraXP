/*
Write a program that gets two numbers from the user, 
then use a function to tell whether they are both even or not. 
Also use a boolean operator. Then in the main program, 
tell the user what was found using this format: 
      The results of our test:  both numbers are even.
Note: you may need the Mod operator %. This is a cousin of 
the divide / operator. It gives you the remainder of a division. 
For example, 5%3  (read 5 mod 3) = 2 (that is, 5 divided by 3 is 
1 remainder 2 - mod reports the remainder).

      alert(`The results of our test: one or both of your numbers is odd.`}
